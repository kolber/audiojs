# audio.js

audiojs is a drop-in javascript library that allows HTML5's `<audio>` tag to
be used anywhere. It uses native `<audio>` where available and falls back
to an invisible flash player to emulate it for other browsers. It also serves
a consistent html player UI to all browsers which can be styled used standard css.

It plays mp3s. **No ogg**. Because, lets be honest, in the real world, no one
really exports ogg files. Sadly, that means Opera and Firefox get flash audio.
Hopefully they can add mp3 support soon.

## Usage

1. Put `audio.js`, `player-graphics.gif` & `audiojs.swf` in the same folder.

2. Include `audio.js`:

        <script src="/audiojs/audio.js"></script>

3. Initialise audiojs:

        <script>
          audiojs.events.ready(function() {
            var as = audiojs.createAll();
          });
        </script>

4. Then you can use `<audio>` wherever you like in your HTML:

        <audio src="/mp3/juicy.mp3" preload="auto" />

## Options

You can customize several options:

    <script>
      var settings: {
        autoplay: false, // If you want it to start playing when the document loads
        loop: false, // The audio will be repeated
        preload: true, // Check this if you want the song to be preloaded
        imageLocation: path + 'player-graphics.gif', // Change the image graphics path
        swfLocation: path + 'audiojs.swf' // Change the path where the flash plugin is stored
      };

      audiojs.events.ready(function() {
        var as = audiojs.createAll(settings);
      });
    </script>

## Build

On OSX, you should install [closure compiler](http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/files/compiler-latest.zip) following the instructions in
[Ben's gist](https://gist.github.com/739724).

Then you can run `rake compile` from root directory and it will package `audio.js`
into `audio.min.js`.

## Compiling Flash from the command line

If you want to mess around with the flash-side of things, you will need to be
able to compile the `.as` file into a `.swf`.

Using the Flex SDK (which is free), flash movies can be compiled
directly from the command line. It makes life that little bit less painful.

### Installing mxmlc

1. Download and unzip the current 'Milestone Release' 'Open Source Flex SDK' from:
   <http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Download+Flex+4>

2. Copy the `bin` folder to `/usr/local/bin/flex/bin/`

3. Add `/usr/local/bin/flex/bin/` to your `PATH`

### Compiling the SWF

Run the following command from within the `audiojs` folder.

    mxmlc audiojs.as
